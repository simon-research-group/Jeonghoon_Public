This repository contains plots of the following: 
1. Time evolution of maximum particle density, particle scale height, and particle-to-gas density ratio at disk mid-plane  (in time_evolution directory). In each time-evolution plot, the grey shaded region represents the interval over which time-averaging is done. The orange horizontal line denotesthe Roche density assuming Toomre Q of 32, and the black vertical lines denotes a moment at which self-gravity of particle is switched on
2. Spacetime diagram (z/H vs time) and 1D vertical profile of particle density (in particle_density_vertical_profiles directory)
3. Final 2D snapshots of particle density (in final_snapshots directory). 
4. To play with the html file (tau-alpha-Z_3Dmap.html; an interative plot), please visit my personal website (https://jhlim.weebly.com/research.html)
