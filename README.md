This repository contains plots of
1. Time evolution of maximum particle density, particle scale height, and particle-to-gas density ratio at disk mid-plane  (in time_evolution directory),
2. Spacetime diagram (z/H vs time) and 1D vertical profile of particle density (in particle_density_vertical_profiles directory),
3. Final snapshots of particle density (in final_snapshots directory). 
4. Summary plots showing threshold for planetesimal formation, time-averaged particle scale height, mid-plane density ratio, vertical gas velocity at the mid-plane, and radial diffusion coefficients of particels. 
for every run presented in Lim et al. in prep.

In each time-evolution plot, the grey shaded region represents the interval over which time-averaging is done, the orange horizontal 
line denotesthe Roche density assuming Toomre Q of 32, and the black vertical lines denotes a moment at which self-gravity of particle is switched on.
